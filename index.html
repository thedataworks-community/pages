			<!-- <h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3">The Challenge</h2> -->
			<p class="mb-3">
				Oklahoma’s HB 2259 was created to reduce court costs for indigent Oklahomans by assessing their ability to pay. But key questions remain:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Do these waivers result in meaningful financial relief?</li>
				<li>
				What is the total amount of court debt avoided?</li>
				<li>
				Does reduced debt lead to fewer failure-to-pay warrants or future charges?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="mb-3">
				Answering these questions requires structured, case-level data—yet the relevant details are buried in fragmented, scanned court documents with a mix of typed and handwritten text.</p>
			<hr/>
			<h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3">Our Solution</h2>
			<p class="mb-3">
				We’ve built a tightly controlled, AI-powered system that extracts and structures complex court data at scale.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				We retrieve relevant records directly from Oklahoma’s public court system using automated search tools.</li>
				<li>We use structured AI tools—guided by Pydantic schemas—to extract key information (balances, eligibility, court findings) from mixed-format documents.</li>
				<li>We store data in a graph database, making it easy to query like a spreadsheet while also mapping deeper relationships across cases, individuals, and outcomes.</li>

			<h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3">Why This Matters</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Measure the real-world impact of debt relief: how much court debt is avoided, and how that affects future warrants or charges.</li>
				<li>Quantify financial benefits: how much money stays in people’s pockets, and whether that leads to greater stability or reduced need for public assistance.</li>

			<p class="mb-3">
				Thousands of people miss court dates every year—not because they’re evading justice, but because they never receive clear or timely notice. These missed appearances (FTAs) often lead to <strong>bench warrants, arrests, and jail stays that could have been avoided.</strong></p>

				The information needed to prevent this—next court dates, times, locations—is public, but <strong>spread across dozens of counties in inconsistent formats.</strong> For many individuals and case managers, keeping up with court schedules is nearly impossible.</p>

					<li>
					We pull next court events daily from public systems using custom-built tools that adapt to the format of each county’s data.</li>

			<blockquote class="blockquote">
				<p>
					On March 14, 2018, the plaintiff took their vehicle to the defendant for scheduled maintenance. The services performed included an oil and filter change, fluid level check, tire pressure adjustments, and a multi-point inspection. The defendant’s technician found that the tread on the plaintiff’s right rear tire was low. However, the defendant did not inform the plaintiff that the tire was unsafe. The plaintiff's car was returned to them on March 15, 2018. On March 25, 2018, the plaintiff was involved in a single-vehicle accident when the car hydroplaned during a heavy rainstorm.</p>
				<p>
					The plaintiff contended that the accident occurred because the defendant failed to properly service the vehicle ten days earlier. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed the defendant was negligent in failing to inspect the tires and warn about the low tread. The plaintiff further alleged negligence in assigning the inspection to an employee who failed to properly notify them of the condition, and in not providing a written copy of the multi-point inspection results. The plaintiff also claimed breach of contract and breach of express and implied warranties, arguing that the maintenance and inspection services were not performed professionally. The plaintiff requested damages in excess of $75,000 for injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering.</p>
				<p>
					The defendant argued that the multi-point inspection was a courtesy and not a required service. They also claimed the plaintiff was distracted and speeding at the time of the accident. The defendant asserted there was no contractual obligation to provide inspection documentation and denied that the low tire tread caused the accident. They maintained they were not negligent and not responsible for the plaintiff’s injuries or damages.</p>
