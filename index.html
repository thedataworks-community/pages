			<h1 class="fs-1 fw-bold mb-4">AI Powered Document Extraction</h1>
			<!-- <h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3">The Challenge</h2> -->
			<p class="mb-3">
				What if the information you need most is buried in handwritten notes, scanned PDFs, or outdated systems—but you still need it structured, accurate, and scalable across tens of thousands of records?
				
				Whether you're analyzing court waivers, social services forms, licensing records, or housing applications, the raw materials are often the same: fragmented documents in inconsistent formats. Solving that bottleneck doesn’t just speed up workflow—it unlocks entirely new ways of understanding the data you already have.</p>
			<h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3">Example Problem</h2>
			<p class="mb-3">
				Oklahoma’s HB 2259 was created to reduce court costs for indigent Oklahomans by assessing their ability to pay. But key questions remain:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Do these waivers result in meaningful financial relief?</li>
				<li>
				What is the total amount of court debt avoided?</li>
				<li>
				Does reduced debt lead to fewer failure-to-pay warrants or future charges?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="mb-3">
				Answering these questions requires structured, case-level data—yet the relevant details are buried in fragmented, scanned court documents with a mix of typed and handwritten text.</p>
				<h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3">Our Solution</h2>
			<p class="mb-3">
				We’ve built a tightly controlled, AI-powered system that extracts and structures complex court data at scale.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				We retrieve relevant records directly from Oklahoma’s public court system using automated search tools.</li>
				<li>We use structured AI tools—guided by Pydantic schemas—to extract key information (balances, eligibility, court findings) from mixed-format documents.</li>
				<li>We store data in a graph database, making it easy to query like a spreadsheet while also mapping deeper relationships across cases, individuals, and outcomes.</li>
			</ul>
			<figure class="text-center my-4">
				<img src="img/cs1-image.png" alt="Example scanned court document" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto">
				<figcaption class="text-muted fst-italic small mt-2">Example of a scanned court document with both typed and handwritten sections.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3">Why This Matters</h2>
			<p class="mb-3">
			Beyond court records, this system offers a blueprint for structuring document-based data in any domain:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Health: Extract data from handwritten intake assessments or care plans</li>
				<li>Education: Structure student-level records from scanned IEPs or counselor notes</li>
				<li>Workforce: Parse job training documents, evaluations, or subsidy applications</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="mb-3">
			If your data lives in messy PDFs, DataWorks can turn it into something you can search, analyze, and use—at scale, across systems, and with validation built in.</p>

			<h1 class="fs-1 fw-bold mb-4">Structured Event Tracking</h1>
			<!-- <h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3">The Challenge</h2> -->
			<p class="mb-3">
				What if you could automatically track key dates—hearings, renewals, deadlines—across dozens of systems and locations, without waiting for someone to manually check a website or pick up the phone?
				
				In every sector, missed dates create consequences: court warrants, lapsed benefits, missed interviews, expired licenses. The information is often public—but fragmented, inconsistently formatted, and hard to access at scale.
				
				We built a system that solves this for courts, but the same approach can power automated monitoring across public records—keeping individuals, teams, and systems on track.</p>
			<h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3">Example Problem</h2>
			<p class="mb-3">
				Thousands of people miss court dates every year—not because they’re evading justice, but because they never receive clear or timely reminders. These missed appearances (failure to appear, FTA) often lead to <strong>bench warrants, arrests, and jail stays that could have been avoided.</strong></p>
			<p class="mb-3">
				The information needed to prevent this—next court dates, times, locations—is public, but <strong>spread across dozens of counties in inconsistent formats.</strong> For many individuals, family members, and case managers, keeping up with court dates is nearly impossible.</p>
			<hr/>
			<h2 class="fs-3 fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3">Our Solution</h2>
			<p class="mb-3">
				We’ve developed an automated system to extract, structure, and monitor upcoming court events across Oklahoma’s 77 counties.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>

			Court reminders are just the start. This type of system can apply anywhere structured scheduling matters—but the source data is a mess.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Justice: Reduce failure-to-appear rates, automate diversion program tracking, or monitor warrants across jurisdictions.</li>
				<li>Workforce & Licensing: Track certification renewals, application deadlines, and compliance check-ins.</li>
				<li>Health & Benefits: Monitor Medicaid recertifications, WIC appointments, or eligibility hearings.</li>
				<li>Housing & Services: Keep clients and caseworkers informed about subsidy renewals, landlord hearings, or application windows.</li>

			</ul>
			Any organization that serves people navigating time-sensitive public systems can benefit from structured, real-time date tracking.

			<p class="mb-3">
				Criminal court records hold the essential details that shape both individual outcomes and system-level insights—charges, sentencing, bond types, warrants, diversion participation, and more. But those elements live in many formats, scattered across scanned documents, docket minutes, and outdated court systems. There is no shared structure, no consistent language, and no reliable way to move this data across platforms or track it at scale—<strong>until now.</strong></p>

			<blockquote class="blockquote">
				<p>
					On March 14, 2018, the plaintiff took their vehicle to the defendant for scheduled maintenance. The services performed included an oil and filter change, fluid level check, tire pressure adjustments, and a multi-point inspection. The defendant’s technician found that the tread on the plaintiff’s right rear tire was low. However, the defendant did not inform the plaintiff that the tire was unsafe. The plaintiff's car was returned to them on March 15, 2018. On March 25, 2018, the plaintiff was involved in a single-vehicle accident when the car hydroplaned during a heavy rainstorm.</p>
				<p>
					The plaintiff contended that the accident occurred because the defendant failed to properly service the vehicle ten days earlier. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed the defendant was negligent in failing to inspect the tires and warn about the low tread. The plaintiff further alleged negligence in assigning the inspection to an employee who failed to properly notify them of the condition, and in not providing a written copy of the multi-point inspection results. The plaintiff also claimed breach of contract and breach of express and implied warranties, arguing that the maintenance and inspection services were not performed professionally. The plaintiff requested damages in excess of $75,000 for injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering.</p>
				<p>
					The defendant argued that the multi-point inspection was a courtesy and not a required service. They also claimed the plaintiff was distracted and speeding at the time of the accident. The defendant asserted there was no contractual obligation to provide inspection documentation and denied that the low tire tread caused the accident. They maintained they were not negligent and not responsible for the plaintiff’s injuries or damages.</p>

			  Client Served by ODMHSAS/Medicaid Behavioral Health Providers (Most Recent 10 Years)<br>
			  Client Counts by County of Residence (Most Recent 10 Years)<br><br>
		  
			  <strong>Who is counted in the system?</strong><br>
			  The system includes individuals who have received a PAID behavioral health service for programs which ODMHSAS contracts with or operates. This includes behavioral health services paid for with Medicaid funding or behavioral health services paid for with state-appropriated, grant-supported, or federally-funded ODMHSAS monies. Includes substance residential, detox, and halfway house services contracted directly with ODMHSAS.<br><br>
		  
			  <strong>Who is not included?</strong><br>
			  Non-outpatient Medicaid-funded behavioral health services, such as most inpatient. The only inpatient counts included are ODMHSAS state-operated inpatient facilities. Data from privately-funded, non-contracted American Indian programs or private insurance is NOT included.<br><br>
		  
			  <strong>What does ‘Not Reported’ mean?</strong><br>
			  Some services (e.g., crisis or initial assessment) do not require providers to report detailed demographics.<br><br>
		  
			  <strong>Why can I only see county of residence in some queries?</strong><br>
			  To protect confidentiality. For example, if a county has only two female Asians aged 0–6, and one received services, the identity may be inferred.<br><br>
		  
			  <strong>What is the difference between ‘Any Drug of Choice’ and ‘Primary Drug of Choice’?</strong><br>
			  Clients may report up to three drugs of choice: primary, secondary, tertiary. 'Primary' only includes the first. 'Any' includes all three.<br><br>
		  
			  <strong>What is a Fiscal Year?</strong><br>
			  Oklahoma’s fiscal year runs July 1 to June 30. E.g., FY22 = July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2022.<br><br>

			  The information presented in the “Profiles Report” is divided into three major reporting categories: (1) Community Characteristics, (2) Educational Process, and (3) Student Performance. This is meant to mirror the real-world educational process. Students have a given home and community life. They attend schools comprised of a diverse makeup of teachers who deliver education through different programs and a variety of teaching styles. And in the end, all of these factors come to bear on each student’s academic performance.<br><br>
			  The “State Profiles” deals with state-level common education issues. It examines the “big picture” of Oklahoma education and it is meant to set the stage for examining education in your part of the state, or within your local community. It contains many tables, graphs, and maps, all with accompanying text. Wherever possible, tables and graphs cover multiple years so that trends may be observed. National comparisons are added where comparable data exists.

			Data was extracted using AI-based visual document processing. Values were not estimated or transformed.</p>
			<p class="small mb-2"><strong>How was the data used in DataWorks Commons?</strong><br>
			The dataset was used to populate the "Oklahoma Education" section in DataWorks Commons. Variables were grouped into categories including Test Scores, Post-Secondary Outcomes, Demographics, and District Revenue. All data is county-level and supports time series comparisons across 2017–2023.</p>
		  
			<!-- Section 3 -->
			<h2 class="fs-5 fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3">3. Transformations & Processing</h2>
			<p class="small mb-2"><strong>Transformations applied:</strong><br>
			None applied. Data was extracted as-is from maps embedded in PDFs.</p>
			<p class="small mb-2"><strong>Processing Logic:</strong><br>
			- PDF pages were converted into images.<br>
			- Each image was analyzed by an AI-powered tool using a structured prompt.<br>

			“The Law Enforcement Agency Reported Crime Analysis Tool (LEARCAT) dashboard enables you to examine crime information reported by participating law enforcement agencies to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS)… LEARCAT presents NIBRS data from 2016 to 2023 on crimes reported by law enforcement to the FBI at both the incident and victimization levels… Rates of incidents or victimizations are calculated by dividing the total number of incidents or victimizations by the associated population for the relevant year and then multiplying by 100,000... Please note that while LEARCAT and the FBI’s Crime Data Explorer (CDE) both present NIBRS data, the two tools use different definitions for some of the offense categories…”

		  - Aggregated city-level values to compute county totals<br>

		  - Used LEARCAT values for 2021–2023 without modification<br>

		  <h2 class="fs-5 fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3">4. Estimates, Interpolation, and Labeling</h2>
		  <p class="small mb-2"><strong>Estimation rationale:</strong><br>
		  LEARCAT data prior to 2021 lacks full county coverage due to NIBRS adoption gaps. Estimates were needed to enable longitudinal analysis.</p>
		  <p class="small mb-2"><strong>Estimation method (plain language):</strong><br>
		  County-level estimates for 2016–2020 were derived from city-level NIBRS crime counts reported in DataWorks Commons. Cities overlapping multiple counties were allocated based on population shares from StatsAmerica. Aggregated county totals were then scaled using an average correction factor derived from LEARCAT county totals in 2021–2023.</p>

		  <code>AdjustedCrimes[c,y] = EstimatedCrimes[c,y] × AvgScalingFactor[c]</code></p>

		  - Counties grouped by <em>CountyType</em>: Metro, Metro-Adjacent, Non-metro<br>

		  <h2 class="fs-5 fw-semibold mt-5 mb-3">5. Data Quality & Limitations</h2>
		  <p class="small mb-2"><strong>Completeness:</strong><br>

		  <p class="small mb-2"><strong>Limitations / Caveats:</strong><br>
		  - All caveats from BJS LEARCAT documentation apply<br>
		  - Differences may exist between LEARCAT and CDE offense definitions<br>
		  - Crime counts reflect agency of report, not necessarily incident location<br>
		  - Rate values only valid for full-reporter states</p>
		  <p class="small mb-2"><strong>Suppressed or imputed values:</strong><br>
		  - Missing values replaced with zeros<br>
		  - Unknowns excluded<br>
		  - City-years with &lt;6 crimes flagged as "Insufficient Size" and removed from county estimates</p>
		  <p class="small mb-2"><strong>Additional flags:</strong><br>
		  - Multi-county city allocations may introduce small error<br>
		  - "Insufficient Size" entries are unreliable and excluded from rate calcs</p>
